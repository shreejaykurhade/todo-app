## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **`react-icons`**: For various visual icons (e.g., checkmark, edit, trash).
* **`axios`**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

### Backend (Assumed)
* This frontend expects a RESTful API backend that handles CRUD operations for `/api/todos`. While the backend code isn't provided here, it would typically be built with technologies like Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, etc., and connect to a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, you'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder>
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Backend Setup:**
    * **Crucially**, this frontend requires a compatible backend API running at `/api/todos`. You will need to set up and run the corresponding backend service separately.
    * Ensure your backend provides the following endpoints:
        * `GET /api/todos`: To fetch all tasks.
        * `POST /api/todos`: To create a new task.
        * `PATCH /api/todos/:id`: To update an existing task (e.g., text or completion status).
        * `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: To delete a task.
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be accessible in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîó API Endpoints (Frontend Expectation)

The frontend interacts with the following RESTful API endpoints:

* `GET /api/todos`: Retrieves an array of all todo objects.
    * Expected response format: `[{ _id: "string", text: "string", completed: boolean }, ...]`
* `POST /api/todos`: Creates a new todo.
    * Request body: `{ text: "string" }`
    * Expected response: The newly created todo object (including `_id`).
* `PATCH /api/todos/:id`: Updates an existing todo by its ID.
    * Request body: `{ text: "string", completed: boolean }` (can be partial)
    * Expected response: The updated todo object.
* `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Deletes a todo by its ID.
    * Expected response: Typically a success status (e.g., 204 No Content or a confirmation message).
